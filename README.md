# We Mark Benches - CO Project Lab
Team Members: **Achim-Balica Vasile, Bașnic Ioan, Belea Sebastian, Cărăbaș Paul, Danciu Georgian, Hovarth Petra**
## What is it?
The benchmark we have created tests the CPU, GPU, HDD, RAM and network functionalities of an Android device. We describe the functionalities of each benchmark in their Design and Implementation sections.


## Why?
At first, the fascination with finding out how and how efficiently our devices work, coupled with our yearning to learn how to work with Android Studio had resulted in us wanting to implement all the basic benchmarks that we have touched on at the CO laboratory in an Android application.

## Main Features
```sh
# Benchmarks
```

```sh
# CPU Benchmark - The CPU benchmark is divided into 3 different parts. Each of the tests strain a different part of the processor in a variety of different ways.
```

```sh
# GPU Benchmark - Not implemented. (it was supposed to start generating geometrical shapes, and generate more and more until the framerate reaches 10fps; there, the benchmark stops and the score is computed based on the number of shapes generated)
```

```sh
# HDD Benchmark - When analysing the efficiency of the HDD or SSD of any device, we actually test how easily and fast the device that we are currently testing stores and retrieves information. So, basically, this Benchmark tests the write and read speeds of the storage component.
```

```sh
# RAM Benchmark - The way that our benchmark analyses the ability of the device it tests is by mapping a large file into the RAM, thus triggering the virtual memory mechanism. Using this method, the evaluation consists of performing reads and writes to the previously mentioned file.

```
```sh
# NET Benchmark - Not implemented. (it was supposed to download 64 MB of data from the internet and store them in a buffer composed of byte sized variables; the score is the download speed in MB/s)

```

## How to use the app
The User Interface is really straight-forward. When you launch the application, you can choose the Benchmark for the component that you wish to test. Once on the Benchmark page, you press the "Start Benchmark" button and wait for the tests to finish. When everything is done, the Benchmark score will be displayed on the screen.

## How to download the app (the APK)
For mobile (Android only), just download the apk from [This link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bLJ4OnllOX8FhoZ-Sn564Ko3988aZu00).
Otherwise, you can use the emulator provided by Android Studio. Just clone or download the files from this repository, import the project in Android Studio, where you can buid and run the app.
