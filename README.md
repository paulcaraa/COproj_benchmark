## What is it?
The benchmark we have created tests the CPU, GPU, HDD and RAM functionalities of an Android device. <trebuie adaugat aici ceva mai mult >

## Why?
At first, the fascination with finding out how and how efficiently our devices work, coupled with our yearning to learn how to work with Android Studio had resulted in us wanting to implement all the basic benchmarks that we have touched on at the CO laboratory in an Android application.

## Main Features
```sh
